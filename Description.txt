O compiled COVID data from a few different publicly available sources as a term project in the Health Informatics and Analytics MSc program at the Tufts University School of Medicine: HIA 217 Multivariable Data Analysis and Visualization. I created a dataset using Python, accessing COVID-19 case and location data through APIs from the US Census and the COVID Tracking Project, and then performed a variety of time-series analysis using linear regression, chi squared tests, and data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python and Tableau.
