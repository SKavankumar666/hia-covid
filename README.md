# COVID-19 Impacts on the US: Assembling a Large Dataset for Regression Analysis and Visualization

I compiled COVID data from a few different publicly available sources as part of a term project for a class in the Health Informatics and Analytics MS program at the Tufts University School of Medicine.

I created a dataset using Python, and then performed a variety of time-series analysis using linear regression, chi squared tests, and data vizualization using the Seaborn and Matplotlib packages and Tableau.
