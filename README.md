# COVID-19 Impacts on the US: Assembling a Large Dataset for Regression Analysis and Visualization

In December 2020, I compiled COVID data from a few different publicly available sources as part of a term project for a class in the Health Informatics and Analytics MSc program at the Tufts University School of Medicine, HIA 217 Multivariable Data Analysis and Visualization.

I created a dataset using Python, acessing COVID-19 case and location data through APIs from the US Census and the COVID Tracking Project and then performed a variety of time-series analysis using linear regression, chi squared tests, and data vizualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python and Tableau.
